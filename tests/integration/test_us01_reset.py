"""
Integration tests for US-01: Start new prediction.

User Story: As a user, I want to click "Nouvelle prédiction" button to reset the form
and see a progress indicator showing "Page 1/6".

Test scenarios:
- T015: "Nouvelle prédiction" button clears all session state
- T016: Progress indicator displays "Page 1/6" after reset

Following TDD: These tests MUST FAIL before implementation.
